    intro: [
      "The Devoted Advisor is the seller a buyer keeps calling long after the deal closes. Not because of charm, and not because of a follow-up cadence. Because somewhere along the way the buyer decided this person tells them the truth and puts their outcome first, and that decision is hard to reverse.",

When the prep is real, the room goes quiet and the buyer starts taking notes. The risk is the reframe that's clever but wrong, or right but delivered to someone who hears it as an insult.

    intro: [
      "The Resilient Hunter lives at the top of the funnel, where the rejection is. Where most sellers ration their outreach to protect their ego, the Hunter runs the numbers and works the volume, because they've made peace with the math: more attempts, more nos, more yeses. The no doesn't sting the way it should, and that's the whole edge.",

      "In a live deal, the Resilient Hunter has three new conversations going before lunch while everyone else is still rewriting one email. The pipeline is always full because the activity never stops. The risk is the deal that needed a slower, more tailored touch and got a template instead, or the burnout that comes from treating every week like a sprint. Your edge is volume nobody can match. Your discipline is knowing which deals to slow down for.",
    sellsBestTo:

      "Aim the engine, don't just run it. Your output is already your superpower, which means the leverage isn't more activity, it's better-targeted activity.

While other sellers wing the multi-stakeholder deal and hope it holds together, the Architect maps it: who decides, who blocks, what each one needs, and in what order it has to happen. The plan is the product.",

      "In a live deal, the Methodical Architect is the one with the mutual action plan the buyer's own team starts relying on to stay organized. Nothing slips, nothing surprises them, and the buyer trusts the process because they can see it working. The risk is the deal that didn't need all that machinery, or the curveball that no plan accounted for and you were slow to adapt to. Your edge is control in complexity. Your growth is flexibility when the plan meets a buyer who won't follow it.",

The first deal is rarely the big one. It's the opening.",

Where most sellers perform a polished version of themselves, the Connector shows up as who they are, says what they actually think, and builds relationships that feel like relationships instead of transactions. Buyers have a radar for performance. With this seller, it stays quiet.",
